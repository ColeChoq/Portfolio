                <p >This website itself is an example of my experience with html and css. Though it is rather simple, it deals with mostly front end development which is 
                    something in which I need more experience. I feel that my skills with javascript as well as other programming languages like the ones exemplified in this 
                    portfolio, are more suited to back end development where graphic design and styling is less important than function.

                <h4>Assignment Description</h4>
                <p>
                    In this assignemnt we were to create a single line of a scrabble board along with the players tile rack.
                    The letters in the players hand were selected randomly from a data structure with the proper distribution of letters
                    as in the real game. The letters were able to be dragged and dropped on both the board and the rack though if they were
                    dropped anywhere else on the screen they were to be returned to the users rack. 
                    The program also was able to identify which tile was dropped in which space and ensure that there were no gaps between 
                    tiles upon submission of the word. The score was calculated correctly based off the letter value as well as potential bonus space values.
                    Any number of words were able to be played until the user uses up all the tiles or chose to restart the game. 
                    The assignment did not have us verify that the words entered were valid so any combination of letters will work.
